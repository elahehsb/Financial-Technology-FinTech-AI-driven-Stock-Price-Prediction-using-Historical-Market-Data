# Financial-Technology-FinTech-AI-driven-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-Historical-Market-Data

### Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging problem that has attracted significant attention in the finance sector. Accurate predictions can help traders make better decisions. This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the future prices of stocks based on historical market data.

### Project Goals
#### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical stock price data, preprocess it for modeling.
#### Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for the prediction model.
#### Model Development: Build and train a time-series forecasting model.
#### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
#### Deployment: Develop a web application to input current stock data and get predictions.

### Steps for Implementation
1. Data Collection
Use publicly available datasets from sources like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage API to collect historical stock price data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Normalization: Normalize numerical features.
Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., moving averages, trading volumes, etc.).

4. Model Development
Develop a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM for time-series forecasting).

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ².

6. Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend.
